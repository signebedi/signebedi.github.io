I am a classicist, social scientist, and software engineer with interests in crisis, caste, and institutions. I have an additional, narrow-ish academic focus on the historiography and political culture of the Roman late-republic, especially as these topics relate to discourses, narratives, and intellectual traditions on the core personages and ideas of that period. I enjoy reading and writing literature, particularly poetry and science fiction. I am a RedHat Certified System Administrator with about fifteen years experience managing Unix systems, developing software, and analyzing data. I've taught a variety of classes in political science and legal studies. All views are my own.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
