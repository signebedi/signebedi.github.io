To that end, I enjoy building logical, extensible systems and APIs. I have a narrow-ish academic focus on the Roman late-republic and later Caesar-biography. I am a Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) with about fifteen years experience managing Unix systems, developing software, and analyzing data. I like to write, hike, and jump through bureaucratic hurdles to stay in shape.</p> </body></html>
