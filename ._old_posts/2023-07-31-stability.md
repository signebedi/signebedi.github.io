Themes: bureaucracy, material culture, stability, legitimacy.

### Introduction

The general principle I would like to explore is extent of the impact of bureaucratic, technological and economic development on stability. My hypothesis is that rapid technological innovation can have a negative impact on stability insofar as it disrupts vested interests and the political status quo. Evidence for this claim is the invention of the printing press. Additionally, I hypothesize that economic development - measured through systems of production and the material culture - has a positive net impact on social stability. Further, I hypothesize that the development of a bureaucracy is a source of stability - especially when social participation in the bureaucracy is widespread, but also when the extent and manner of social participation in the bureaucracy is accepted by the populace as legitimate. Evidence in the negative that supports this claim is the political weakness of Weimar and the subsequent ascendance of the NSDAP.

The bureaucracy produces stability and holding power that is difficult for an Adventurer to subvert - Mohammed, in the Hijaz, had the benefit of a largely unorganized administration upon which to assert his will. 

For it is far easier to replace "nothing" with "something", than to exchange "something" for "something else" â€¦ that is, something of a different sort. 


Not only does the bureaucracy produce stability, but it increases the cost of change. Perhaps these are the same thing. This is known as path dependence. 

This applies to software too  https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/, which shows how reinventing the wheel with a large codebase can spell disaster for it's market share. 

Satisfactory - a game JMK recommends- also shows how cost-free reallocation of resources makes the player more likely to engage in change-based behavior and undermine path dependence.
