Part of the difficulty of teaching this subject is in helping students understand how and why the underlying concepts change over time. This presents an interesting “teaching methods” challenged that I’ve contemplated throughout the semester and struggled to find a good solution for.</p> <p>I view this fundamentally as a definitional problem: it’s hard to pin down a comprehensive meaning for Liberalism or Conservatism, partly because of the long, complex history of the two traditions, partly because of the mixing of theories that practical politics tends to effectuate. Early in the class, we tackled this by building mind maps of both ideas, establishing links and anti-links to gain a better understanding of each theory’s tenets and how they related. Recurring themes for Liberalism tended to include concepts like change, progress, free markets, liberty, and equality, while Conservatism usually included tradition, religion, hierarchy, and stability. But this still didn’t account for changes to the ideas over time - that is, why a tenent like “tradition” might look different if you examine how the principle is carried out in the 18th Century as opposed to the 21st Century.</p> <p>One possible solution I considered was a participatory model where we created actual hats labeled “conservative” and “liberal” that students could wear as part of the classroom activities to think through historical problems from different perspectives, which would (in theory) free them from needing to take personal responsibility for challenging world views while allowing us still to derive learning value from these, and which we could introduce more complex sub-variants to as the course progressed (an “economic liberal” hat, for example). I decided against using this as my initial approach, however, because I felt it put too much pressure on students early in the semester - though it may prove a useful activity later on when students are more comfortable with the subject matter.</p> <p>Another approach, however, would be using abstractions. In law school, I took Trusts and Estates with a remarkable and engaging professor named Howard Erlanger, and part of his teaching method involved approaching complex ideas through a set of “Erlanger’s Paradoxes” - a sort of theoretical shorthand to help students reach analytical conclusions faster given a limited set of facts. I had a chance to sit down with him and pick his brain about my somewhat comparable pedagogical predicament, leading to what I’ve taken to calling, in conscious emulation of my intellectual upstream, “Sig’s Abstractions.”</p> <p>I’m writing this post <em>in media res</em> (with mixed feelings about my students reading it) because doing so has been helpful in developing the abstractions further, as well as a language to discuss them with my students. It’s important to note, however - and I hope my students understand this - that this discussions is primarily rooted in the American context and the interpretations of Liberalism and Conservatism presented here may grate with non-American perspectives on the same.</p> <h4 id="i-the-horse-race">I. The horse race</h4> <p>The first problem I’ve experienced in teaching Liberalism and Conservatism is, put simply, why neither of these ideas look exactly the same as they did in the past. As an example: Adam Smith’s Liberalism placed, I think, a far greater emphasis on free markets than today’s Liberalism, which has adopted intervention as a core tenet. To square this circle, we would probably need to reach two conclusions: first, that Liberalism outpaces conservatism; second, that Conservatism is nonetheless also a “moving” idea that changes over time, though perhaps not at the same pace as Liberalism. I find that this is best illustrated by the analogy of a horse race: if Liberalism and Conservatism were two horses that, for the purpose of the discussion, are situated at the same starting gate, then which horse will outpace the other at any arbitrary time?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of the horse race (source: author) </div> <p>If you put your money on Liberalism, then you’ve correctly made sense of the analogy. But, a more challenging question: does the fact that Liberalism outpaces Conservatism mean that the Conservatism horse never left the starting post? Of course not. Conservatism tried to keep up with the faster horse but never outpaces it because, to it, the race is not necessarily to the fastest. Perhaps, to take this analogy a bit firther, Conservatism wishes that the race were oriented in the opposite direction, but at the same time doesn’t want to be left behind by the faster horse running the other way. Thus, we see Conservatism today adopt all manner of ideas that, in the 19th Century, might have seemed alien to those who used that label to describe themselves.</p> <h4 id="ii-caduceus">II. Caduceus</h4> <p>The second teaching problem I’ve experienced is why the two ideas seem sometimes to leverage similar language and ideas, or might be used to justify the same policies, despite differing significantly in their intellectual tradition and worldview. A good way to think about this might be that Liberalism and Conservatism are not ideas that exist in a vacuum - their scholars read each other’s work and respond to the same events, and intertexts are inevitable when given enough time. A useful way to visualize how concepts might converge is the image of the caduceus, a symbol that depicts two snakes wrapped around a staff and aptly conveys a sense of mediation and diplomacy. Beyond my personal predilection for the classics, I’ve found that students are also interested in the strange symbols from antiquity and think that the novelty of the image helps grab and keep their attention.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="height: 50%;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Two serpents wrapped around a staff (source: Ernest de Sarzec - Choquin de Sarzec, Ernest (1832-1901), Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) </div> <p>So, in visualizing this abstraction in a manner similar to the first, we might plot Liberalism and Conservatism as a wave function and its inverse, with the two waves periodically intersecting with one another.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of two intersecting waves (source: author) </div> <h4 id="iii-ouroboros">III. Ouroboros</h4> <p>The two previous abstractions presume that knowledge, culture, and institutions are constantly moving forward. However, this linear progression doesn’t always hold true in the real world. Ideas don’t just move forward; they also circle back, revisiting and reinterpreting past concepts. This leads us to a third teaching problem: why the ideas often seem to hearken back or revert to past approaches. Admittedly, this phenomenon is something that will become more apparent in discussions of more recent events as we are able to observe how history sometimes “repeats itself.” For example, debates around the First National Bank were largely focused on constitutional interpretation, but later debates were able to leverage experience and history as evidence for or against the bank’s rechartering.</p> <p>The practice of “hearkening back” might be a less surprising phenomenon for Conservatism, which places far greater an emphasis on history and tradition - but even Liberalism has a tendency toward archaics. Take, for instance, the resurgence of classical liberal ideas among libertarians. While classical liberalism emphasizes individual liberty and limited government, it’s been reinterpreted and adapted by modern libertarians to address contemporary issues. Whether or not libertarians constitute a Liberal or Conservative group will necessarily invite debate, but what’s clear is that their core tenets draw heavily from early Liberal thought.</p> <p>I think this idea is nicely modeled by the tail eater (Attic: οὐροβόρος), another ancient symbol of life, death, and rebirth - or, in a more abstract sense, the cyclicality that permeates all areas of life, to help illustrate how Liberalism and Conservatism don’t just move forward, but can sometimes hearken to old arrangements.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The serpent devours its own tail (source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Serpiente_alquimica.jpg">anonymous medieval illuminator; uploader Carlos adanero</a>, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) </div> <p>Represented in the same manner as the earlier two abstractions, it might look like two circles converging back upon themselves.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of two curves converging back on themselves (source: author) </div> ]]></content><author><name>Sig Janoska-Bedi</name></author><category term="essays"/><category term="meta"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[abstract approaches to Liberalism and Conservatism]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a brief ‘hello world’</title><link href="https://signebedi.github.io/blog/2023/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a brief ‘hello world’"/><published>2023-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://signebedi.github.io/blog/2023/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://signebedi.github.io/blog/2023/hello-world/"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I was very grateful to find myself backpacking on the <a href="https://superiorhiking.org/trail-section/silver-bay-to-caribou-river-wayside/">Superior Hiking Trail</a> and had the chance to relax with my group at a campground off the Beaver River, in an area north of Two Harbors, MN. I spent some time submerged in the water and attuning myself to the tranquil sounds of birdsong, the rustling of leaves in the wind, and the water lapping against nearby stones. In the overwhelming synchronicity of the moment, a few thoughts crossed my mind that I hope you’ll permit me to share here.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Beaver River (source: author) </div> <h4 id="i-objects">I. Objects</h4> <p>I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities my life has provided to participate in the activities, rituals, and institutions of modern western society but, as the scope of one’s participation in these increases, so too do the transaction costs, which waste our time, frustrate us, and deprive us of perspective. We all experience these transaction costs, or at least are aware of their existence - commuting time, monthly fees, paperwork, and a thousand login credentials to websites we haven’t visited in years. On the one hand, these frustrations can be written off as the price we pay to enjoy society’s abstractions; on the other, they make life less fulfilling and breed resentment against the very things that have improved our material quality of life so much over the last century.</p> <p>What strikes me most about modernity is our remarkable preoccupation with objects. Perhaps you’ll permit me the platitude that we have far too many “things” that sap our attention and disrupt our ability to be pleased with what we have. That’s not to say that past societies were unconcerned with material culture - they were. But my use of “object” is not perfectly synonymous with materialism, as is it strictly and directly applicable to tangible objects. Intead, my use of this term privileges a perceived shift in mindset that has occurred: from experiences, observations, and tradition toward what Michael Oakeshott might have derided as an arrogant focus on objectivity and rationalism. <d-footnote>Oakeshott (1991). 7-13.</d-footnote> I suppose my argument, if there is one, would be that this societal shift has corresponded with shift where the “things” we have become a proxy for less tangible forms of meaning-making. I’d like to also be very clear that my argument is not intended to resemble Fukuyama’s “last man” who, with nothing meaningful left to think or do, consigns himself to a life of boredom, hedonism, and directionless toil. <d-footnote>Fukuyama (1992). xxii-xxiii.</d-footnote> Indeed, there are many problems yet to solve, and much still to give our lives some meaning. My claim, put simply, is that something about modernity has increased the scale of consumption &amp; that, as a result, the “object” the most available locus through which to experience the world.</p> <p>The thing about objects is that they can be broken, discarded, and replaced - indeed, it has always fascinated me that a nontrivial body of evidence of ancient material culture comes from garbage dumps. <d-footnote>Eg. Ezban (2012)</d-footnote> This fact may help with the challenge of defining an object within the scope of this essay: the difference between an object within my usage, and the broader class of material culture, is that an object, insofar as we are talking about a physical thing, ought to be understood as being disposable. So, I suppose there is a subjective component to this definition that asks: what is disposable to you? One person, may mapp significant meaning onto something’s existence, its function, or perhaps their mere possession of it; for another, that same thing may be a simple tool to throw away when its job is complete. For one, the “thing” is important in its own right, but for the other it is a mere instrumentality. So, we can probably the preceding discussion as “our use of disposable tools has increased.”</p> <p>In its ephemerality, an object resembles the baited breath of the human life that, faced with urgency, must hasten to achieve its objective. Every object we grasp - and, all the more so, their accumulation <em>en masse</em> - is a sort of Faustian Bargain, a lease on the opportunity to employ «object as tool» to attain our increasingly lofty goals within a still-very-limited lifespan. In some ways, objects invite further abstraction and social complexity. Take, for example, the vessel - an object that carries other objects, to be sure, but also - especially in Bronze Age cultures - to carry things ritual signifance, like human remains. <d-footnote>See generally Cole (1979).</d-footnote> In some ways, modern life is less urgent, and the objects are more readily available. But in another sense, life is far more scarce, as we are greedy for achievement or, perhaps, society is greedy to harvest individual achievements to its own ends. To twist an old tale: we construct ever-waxier wings in an effort to strive closer and closer to the sun.</p> <p>For some reason, this makes me think of C.G. Jung’s writings on typology - especially what he referred to as the extroverted thinking type. On this, Jung stated that “the extroverted thinking type will, by definition, be a man whose constant endeavor…. is to make all his activities dependent on intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always oriented by objective data, whether these be external facts or generally accepted ideas.” <d-footnote>Jung (1921). ¶ 585.</d-footnote> Modernity is shaped in a manner favoring this kind of thinking, and it rewards extroverted thinkers with plenty of objects, real and figurative, through which to engage with the world.</p> <p>At the same time, the structure of our society seems to have deprived their those who do not think in this way of proportionately meaningful symbols through which to engage with themselves and others. Here, the introverted types - especially the intuitive and feeling types - are useful to bring into the conversation because this category describes those to whom subjective images provide much more meaning, and to whom the outside structs of every day social life might sometimes seem, at best, superfluous and, at worst, grating.<d-footnote>Eg. Ibid. ¶ 638, 642. On this, Jung writes that "introverted feeling is conditioned subjectively and is only secondarily concerned with the object," while primarily concerning itself with "deeply felt, unconscious images."</d-footnote> There is further analogy to be made on the relationship between social order, decadence, and nature - but this probably warrants a separate discussion/ <d-footnote>My knowledge on this subject is limited, but Paglia (1990) presents an interesting, if maybe controversial, way of thinking about the world in terms of Apollonian order and Dionysian nature. There is also Nietzsche...</d-footnote></p> <h4 id="ii-masks">II. Masks</h4> <p>One hypothesis I have is that our preoccupation with objects means that we will more often tend “mask” when we participate in social institutions, insofar as engaging with the world outside of ourselves - full of things and people with their own interests, ideologies, and agency - requires us to sacrifice certain aspects of our true self in order to facilitate a functioning society. I am not trying to assert that masks are bad <em>per se</em>, but instead point out some of their drawbacks. To one person, masking might induce a stress response when the mask deprives them of opportunities for genuine self-expression; to another, masks might be a comfortable way to avoid outside scrutiny or introspection, which, though sometimes difficult, is nonetheless good for long term satisfaction in life. Nor am I trying to assert that masks are some kind of new phenomenon, but rather that modernity has given them new forms and thrusts them upon us at every turn: literal mask wearing, like Comic-Con attendees dressing as their favorite heroes and villains; physical masks, like a face-lift or nose job; abstract masks, like a professionally-curated social media presence - all of these have given us new pathways to hide ourselves away from each other, and ultimately, I would argue, from ourselves.</p> <p>Widespread masking threatens the usefulness of an individual’s social experiences, observations, and perceptions, because we employ our senses to make sense of the world and seek after truth. Masks evince a comparable effect to the shadows in Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. But I think that we also understand the disadvantages of an “over masked” society and have developed structs for recognizing and moving away from a masked persona when doing so promotes the social good. I think a good example of such a struct is the image of the third eye, itself a sort of mask that is commonly used in art to represent introspection and self-awareness, helping us understand and realize certain truths about ourselves. <d-footnote>Eg. Napier (1987). 139, 149.</d-footnote> It is commonly worn in subcontinental culture as a tilaka, which is a sort of mask drawn on a person’s forehead.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Nepali sadhu with a tilaka on his forehead (Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kathmandu,_Nepal,_Sadhu.jpg">© Vyacheslav Argenberg / http://www.vascoplanet.com/</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0">CC BY 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons) </div> <p>The third eye gazes inward, yes. But it is also an instrument of destruction. In the Hindu tradition, Shiva’s third eye opens to eradicate evil from the universe. Likewise, the third eye as a human symbol might propose to uproot those things about ourselves that are not desirable and force us instead to reckon with the subjective self whether we want to or not. Thus, it is sort of an “anti-mask”, as we train it inward just as we might display it outward; we employ it as a way of realization, rather than as a form of obfuscation. My favorite illustration of the third eye serving this function is Frank Herbert’s Dune, where characters invoke the image to overcome paroxysms of fear.<d-footnote>Herbert (1965).</d-footnote></p> <div class="poem"> <div class="stanza"> <div class="line"> <div class="original"></div> <div class="translation">I must not fear.

Flow</h4> <p>Introspection in general can be a troubling business because it forces us to confront certain aspects of ourselves about which we are least comfortable and have hidden away from the gaze of others. But to build a life that is fulfilling, we must sometimes endure discomfort. Some people reject, rebel, or run away from themselves (through, for example, drug use or vapid consumerism) or from society (like a hermit who goes to live in the woods). But there may be a third option in the cultivation of flow, by which I mean the feeling of wellness and satisfaction that we experience through total, active involvement of the self with the world around it. <d-footnote>Csikszentmihalyi (1997). 71.</d-footnote> Flow is interesting to me because it is something that allows us to immerse ourselves in society’s activities without alienating us from the self. The chief accomplishment of someone who reaches flow quite often, according to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is the “Autotelic Personality,” which refers to one who enjoys their activities for their own sake, rather than for the material benefits they might bestow.</p> <p>Take, for example, my decision to start this blog. In many ways, doing so is antithetical to my <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Midwest%20Nice">midwest-nice</a> outlook toward life, which entails, amongst other things, an appreciation of humility in myself and others. Something about writing about myself or, even worse, presuming others might want to read what I write strikes me as particularly self-indulgent and inconsistent with my worldview. And yet, here I am, and here you are. At the risk sounding somewhat attenuated, there’s an essay called “This is Water” by David Foster Wallace - well rehearsed across American college campuses at this point, but nonetheless useful to us here - where he tells the story of a religious man and an atheist arguing over the existence of God. The atheist shares a story about how he had been caught in a snowstorm a few weeks before and prayed to God to save him. The religious man is relieved because, seeing as the atheist survived, it was clear to him that it was God who had saved him. But the atheist writes him off, instead dedicating his salvation to a few passers-by who pulled him from the snow.<d-footnote>Wallace (2009).</d-footnote> Wallace highlights how both men mapped their subjective beliefs onto the atheist’s life-or-death experience, without necessarily directing their attention toward, or cultivating any manner of consciousness about, the other’s perspective. Wallace thought of this as being a problem of compassion, but I think it is one of attention. Preventing situations like these is exactly the social function that experiences like flow can serve. By paying closer attention, we can, at the very least, come to understand the worldviews of others instead of being locked behind the limiting bars of our own.</p> <h4 id="iv-interfaces">IV. Interfaces</h4> <p>I am somebody who primarily views the world through the lens of interfaces. Facilitating interconnectivity between things that are understood to be different-in-kind is a deeply pleasing process that is, to me, its own reward. The concept of an interface is typically applied to man-made systems, instruments, and ideas; but this concept is useful in other areas of life. What I appreciated about the moment I spent in the Beaver River was the sparks of interconnectivity I felt between myself and the world around me, and it was my attention to the world around me that fastened me to it in that moment. Throughout my life, I have often drunk water when I was thirsty and covered myself in a blanket when I was cold but, in the theme of Wallace’s essay, this was a rare moment where I could recognize that it was water that I was swimming in. I sat in the Beaver River for awhile before, standing up, I felt a warm breeze wrap itself around my body, recalling a verse I had memorized for a high school English class. <d-footnote>Chaucer (c. 1400). 1.1.</d-footnote></p> <div class="poem"> <div class="stanza"> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth</div> <div class="translation">When the West Wind also with its sweet breath</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Inspired hath in every holt and heeth</div> <div class="translation">In every wood and field has breathed life into</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne</div> <div class="translation">The tender new leaves, and the young sun</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Hath in the Ram his half cours yronne,</div> <div class="translation">Has run half its course in Aries</div> </div> </div> </div> <p>So, I’ve decided to call this blog <a href="https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/zephyrus-e12216400"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zephyrus</code></a>, something I am doing ‘for its own sake’ where I can lay down my masks and reflect upon &amp; celebrate the human experience through intellectual lenses available to me. I hope that, like a summer breeze, these musings may be a source of comfort to you as they are to me.</p> <div style="display: none;"> <d-cite key="oakeshott1991"></d-cite> <d-cite key="fukuyama1992end"></d-cite> <d-cite key="ezban2012trash"></d-cite> <d-cite key="coles1979bronze"></d-cite> <d-cite key="jung1921psychological"></d-cite> <d-cite key="paglia1990sexual"></d-cite> <d-cite key="napier1987masks"></d-cite> <d-cite key="csikszentmihalyi1997finding"></d-cite> <d-cite key="herbert1965dune"></d-cite> <d-cite key="chaucer1400"></d-cite> <d-cite key="wallace2009"></d-cite> </div>]]></content><author><name>Sig Janoska-Bedi</name></author><category term="essays"/><category term="meta"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[let's get this party started]]></summary></entry></feed>
