The site had access to the water, which was cool, gently-flowing, and soothing. I spent some time sitting half-submerged and enjoyed the tranquil sounds of birdsong, the rustling of leaves in the wind, and the water lapping against nearby stones as my group set up camp. I closed my eyes and pictured a knot unwinding against the sensation of water rising and falling against my back &amp; my life stressors left my body.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Beaver River (source: author) </div> <p>I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities my life has provided to participate in the activities, rituals, and institutions of western society, but, as my participation in these has increased, so too have the transaction costs, which waste our time, frustrate us, and deprive us of perspective. One one hand, these can be written off as the price we pay to enjoy society’s abstractions; on the other, they make life less fulfilling and breed resentment against the very abstraction that has made the material quality of life improve so much in the last century.</p> <p>What strikes me most about modernity is our remarkable preoccupation with objects. That’s not to say that past societies were unconcerned with material culture, but that the increased scale of consumption has made the object the most available locus of experience. In his writings on personality typology, C.J. Jung stated that “the extroverted thinking type will, by definition, be a man whose constant endeavor - in so far, of course, as he is a pure type - is to make all his activities dependent on intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always oriented by objective data, whether these be external facts or generally accepted ideas.” <d-cite key="jung1921psychological"></d-cite> Likewise, the modern west rewards the extroverted thinkers with plenty of objects through which to analyze the world, and at the same time deprives their counterparts - the introverted feeling types - of proportionately meaningful symbols.</p> <p>Preoccupation with the object means that we are all wearing masks when we participate in social instututions, because we are engaging with things outside of ourselves and not seriously engaging with the subjective aspects of ourselves. Masks are far from a new phenomenon, but modernity has given them new forms: literal mask wearing, like Comic-Con attendees dressing as their favorite heroes and villains; physical masks, like a face-lift or plastic surgery; abstract masks, like a professionally-curated social media presence - all of these have given us new pathways to hide ourselves away from each other, and from ourselves.</p> <p>One of the most intriguing masks is that of the third eye, an image that symbolizes a looking-inward, which helps us understand and realize certain truths about ourselves.<d-cite key="napier1987masks"></d-cite> But, just as the third eye gazes inward, it is also an instrument of destruction as we uproot those things about ourselves that are not desirable and force a reckoning with subjective experience. In that way, it is sort of an “anti-mask”, as we train it inward as a way of realization rather than display it outward as a form of obfuscation.</p> <p>My favorite illustration of this anti-mask is Frank Herbert’s Litany Against, “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”<d-cite key="herbert1965dune"></d-cite> Introspection can be a troubling business because it forces us to confront certain aspects of ourselves about which we are least comfortable and have hidden away from the gaze of others. But to build a life that is fulfilling, we must treat</p> <p>This introspection can be a troubling business, leading us to question whether we need an escape. One option is to retreat from society and spend our lives in contemplation, but a more appealing alternative might be to lean into the world we’ve created and cultivate more reasonable forms of meaning. This could involve cultivating flow, <d-cite key="csikszentmihalyi1997finding"></d-cite> or developing an Autotelic personality, where we focus on the activity itself rather than its purpose. This would free us from the constraints of the “extroverted thinker” and allow us to enjoy activities for their own sake.</p> <p>After sitting awhile in Beaver River, I rose from the water and the summer breeze ran sweetly across my limbs, giving me a sense of wellbeing. I recalled a verse I had memorized in my youth describing Zephyrus, the Greek personification of the west wind.<d-cite key="chaucer2023"></d-cite></p> <div class="poem"> <div class="stanza"> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth</div> <div class="translation">When the West Wind also with its sweet breath</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Inspired hath in every holt and heeth</div> <div class="translation">In every wood and field has breathed life into</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne</div> <div class="translation">The tender new leaves, and the young sun</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Hath in the Ram his half cours yronne,</div> <div class="translation">Has run half its course in Aries</div> </div> </div> </div> <p>So, in honor of this experience, I will call this blog <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zephyrus</code>, something I am doing ‘for its own sake’.
