I have the distinct pleasure of teaching a course this semester on how Liberalism and Conservatism shaped American history. Part of the difficulty of teaching this subject is in helping students understand how and why the underlying concepts change over time. This presents an interesting "teaching methods" challenged that I've contemplated throughout the semester and struggled to find a good solution for. 

Fundamentally, I view this as a definitional problem: it's hard to pin down a comprehensive meaning for Liberalism or Conservatism. Early in the class, we tackled this by building mind maps of both ideas, establishing links and anti-links to gain a better understanding. Recurring themes for Liberalism tended to include concepts like change, liberty, and equality, while Conservatism usually included tradition, hierarchy, and stability. But this still didn't account for changes to the ideas over time - that is, why "tradition, hierarchy, and stability" might look different if you examine how these principles are carried out in the 18th Century as opposed to the 21st Century.

In law school, I took my class on Trusts and Estates with a remarkable and engaging professor named Howard Erlanger, and part of his teaching method involved approaching complex ideas through a set of "Erlanger Paradoxes".  I had a chance to sit down with him and pick his brain about my somewhat comparable pedagogical predicament, leading to what I've taken to calling, in conscious emulation of my intellectual upstream, "Sig's Abstractions."

I'm writing this post *in media res* (and hoping that my students don't read it) because doing so has been helpful in developing the abstractions further and developing a language to discuss them with my discussion groups. It's important to note, however - and I hope my students understand this - that the discussions here are primarily rooted in the American context and the interpretations of Liberalism and Conservatism presented may grate with non-American perspectives on the same.

#### I. The horse race

The first problem I've experienced in teaching Liberalism and Conservatism is, put simply, why neither of these ideas look exactly the same as they did in the past. As an example: Adam Smith's Liberalism placed, I think, a far greater emphasis on free markets than today's Liberalism, which has adopted intervention as a core tenet. To square this circle, we need to reach two conclusions: first, that Liberalism outpaces conservatism; second, that Conservatism is nonetheless also a "moving" idea that changes over time, though perhaps not at the same pace as Liberalism. I find that this is best illustrated by the analogy of a horse race: if Liberalism and Conservatism were two horses that, for the purpose of the discussion, are situated at the same starting gate, then which horse will eventually outpace the other?

If you put your money on Liberalism, then you've correctly made sense of the analogy. But, a more challenging question: does the fact that Liberalism outpaces Conservatism mean that the Conservatism horse never left the starting post? Of course not. Conservatism tried to keep up with the faster horse but never outpaces it because, to it, the race is not necessarily to the fastest alone. Thus, we see Conservatism today adopt all manner of ideas that, in the 19th Century, might have seemed utterly alien to those who used that label to describe themselves.

#### II. Caduceus

The second teaching problem I've experienced is why the two ideas seem sometimes to leverage similar language and ideas, or might be used to justify the same policies, despite differing significantly in their intellectual tradition and worldview. A good way to think about this might be that Liberalism and Conservatism are not ideas that exist in a vacuum - their scholars read each other's work and respond to the same events, and intertexts are inevitable when given enough time. A useful way to visualize how concepts might converge is the image of the caduceus, a symbol that depicts two snakes wrapped around a staff and aptly conveys a sense of mediation and diplomacy.

So, in visualizing this abstraction in a manner similar to the first, we might plot Liberalism and Conservatism as a wave function and its inverse, with the two waves intersecting with one another periodically.

#### III. Ouroboros

Finally, the two previous abstractions presume that knowledge, culture, and institutions are constantly moving forward. However, this linear progression doesn't always hold true in the real world. Ideas don't just move forward; they also circle back, revisiting and reinterpreting past concepts. This leads us to the final teaching problem: why the ideas often seem to hearken back or revert to past approaches. Admittedly, this phenomenon is something that will become more apparent in discussions of more recent events as we are able to observe how history sometimes "repeats itself." Further, this might be a less surprising phenomenon for Conservatism, which places far greater an emphasis on history and tradition - but even Liberalism has a tendency toward archaics. Take, for instance, the resurgence of classical liberal ideas among libertarians. While classical liberalism emphasizes individual liberty and limited government, it's been reinterpreted and adapted by modern libertarians to address contemporary issues. Whether or not libertarians constitute a Liberal or Conservative party will necessarily invite debate, but what's clear is that their core tenets draw moe from early Liberal thought that Conservative thought.

I think this idea is nicely modeled by the tail eater (Attic: οὐροβόρος), a symbol of life, death, and rebirth - or, in a more abstract sense, the cyclicality that permeates all areas of life, to help illustrate how Liberalism and Conservatism don't just move forward, but can sometimes return to old arrangements.

Represented in the same manner as the earlier two abstractions, it might look like two circles converging back upon themselves.
