I have the distinct pleasure of teaching a course on how Liberalism and Conservatism shaped American history this semester. Part of the problem of teaching this subject is in helping students understand how and why the underlying concepts change over time. This presents an interesting "teaching methods" question that I've contemplated for throughout the semester and struggled to find a good solution for. 

Fundamentally, I view this as a definitional problem: it's hard to pin down the meaning of Liberalism or Conservatism. Early in the class, we tackled this by building mind maps of both ideas, establishing links and anti-links between them to approach more comprehensive definitions. For example, recurring themes for Liberalism included change, liberty, and equality, while Conservatism usually included tradition, hierarchy, and stability. But this still didn't help understand **changes over time** - that is, what "tradition, hierarchy, and stability" might look like will differ if you examine how these principles are carried out in the 18th Century as opposed to the 21st Century.

In law school, I took my class on Trusts and Estates with a remarkable and engaging professor named Howard Erlanger, and part of his teaching method involved approaching complex ideas through a set of "Erlanger Paradoxes".  I had a chance to sit down with him and pick his brain about my somewhat comparable pedagogical predicament, leading to what I've taken to calling, in conscious emulation of my intellectual upstream, "Sig's Abstractions."

I'm writing this post *in media res* (and hoping that my students don't read it) because doing so has been helpful in developing the abstractions further and developing a language to discuss them with my discussion groups. It's important to note, however - and I hope my students understand this - that the discussions here are primarily rooted in the American context and the interpretations of Liberalism and Conservatism presented may grate with non-American perspectives on the same.

#### I. The horse race

The first problem I've experienced in teaching Liberalism and Conservatism is, put simply, why neither of these ideas look exactly the same as they did in the past. As an example: Adam Smith's Liberalism placed, I think, a far greater emphasis on free markets than today's Liberalism, which has adopted intervention as a core tenet. To square this circle, we need to reach two conclusions: first, that Liberalism outpaces conservatism; second, that Conservatism is nonetheless also a "moving" idea that changes over time, though perhaps not at the same pace as Liberalism. I find that this is best illustrated by the analogy of a horse race: if Liberalism and Conservatism were two horses that, for the purpose of the discussion, are situated at the same starting gate, then which horse will eventually outpace the other?

If you picked Liberalism, then you've correctly made sense of the analogy. But, a more challenging question: does the fact that Liberalism outpaces Conservatism mean that the Conservatism horse never left the starting post? Of course not. Conservatism tried to keep up with the faster horse but never outpaces it because, to mix analogies, the race is not necessarily to the fastest alone. Thus, we see Conservatism today adopt all manner of ideas that, in the 19th Century, might have seemed utterly alien to those who used that label to describe themselves.

#### II. Caduceus

The second problem I've experienced in teaching Liberalism and Conservatism is why the two ideas seem sometimes to leverage similar language and ideas, or might be used to justify the same policies. A good way to think about this might be that Liberalism and Conservatism are not ideas that remain in a vacuum - their scholars read each other's work and respond to the same events, and intertexts are inevitable when given enough time. A useful way to visualize this idea might be the caduceus, a symbol that depicts two snakes wrapped around a herald's staff and aptly conveys a sense of mediation and diplomacy.

So, in visualizing this abstraction in a manner similar to the first, we might plot Liberalism and Conservatism as a wave function and its inverse, with the two waves intersecting with one another periodically.

#### III. Ouroboros

Finally, the two previous approaches presume an Hegelian worldview - the ideas are constantly moving forward. But the fact that this presumption does not always hold true leads us to the final problem I've experienced: why the ideas often seem, in contravention to the two abstractions raised earlier, to hearken back or revert to past approaches. Admittedly, this phenomenon is something that will come about in discussions of more recent events as history is given the chance to "repeat itself". Further, this might be a less surprising phenomenon for Conservatism, which places far greater an emphasis on history and tradition - but even Liberalism has a tendency toward archaics. Take, perhaps, the resurgence of classical liberal ideas among Libertarians, who tend to believe in minimal government intervention, laissez-faire capitalism, low taxes, and individual liberty - though it might not be safe to presume that this group would really constitute a "Liberal" party in the modern understanding of the idea.

I think this idea is nicely modeled by the tail eater (Attic: οὐροβόρος), a symbol of life, death, and rebirth - or, in a more abstract sense, Platonic cyclicality. It's apt, then, to help illustrate how Liberalism and Conservatism don't just move forward, but can sometimes return to old arrangements.

Represented in the same manner as the earlier two abstractions, it might look like two circles converging back upon themselves.
