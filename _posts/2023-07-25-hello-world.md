A few weeks ago, I was backpacking on the [Superior Hiking Trail](https://superiorhiking.org/trail-section/silver-bay-to-caribou-river-wayside/) and had the chance to relax with my group at a campground off the Beaver River, in an area north of Two Harbors, MN. I spent some time sitting half-submerged in the water and zoning out to the tranquil sounds of birdsong, the rustling of leaves in the wind, and the water lapping against nearby stones as the others set up their tents. In the overwhelming synchronicity of the moment, a few thoughts crossed my mind that I'd like to share here.

#### I. Objects

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities my life has provided to participate in the activities, rituals, and institutions of modern western society but, as the scope of my participation in these has increased, so too have the transaction costs, which waste our time, frustrate us, and deprive us of perspective. We all experience these transaction costs, or at least are aware of their existence - commuting time, monthly fees, paperwork, and a thousand login credentials to websites we haven't visited for years. On one hand, these frustrations can be written off as the price we pay to enjoy society's abstractions; on the other, they make life less fulfilling and breed resentment against the very things that have improved our material quality of life so much over the last century.

What strikes me most about modernity is our remarkable preoccupation with objects. Perhaps you'll permit me the platitude that we have far too many "things" that sap our attention and disrupt our ability to be pleased with what we have. That's not to say that past societies were unconcerned with material culture - they were. But my use of "object" is not perfectly synonymous with materialism, privileging instead a shift in mindset from experiences, history, and tradition toward Oakeshott-style rationalism - and a corresponding shift where the "things" become a proxy for less tangible forms of meaning-making.<d-footnote>Oakeshott (1991). 7-13.</d-footnote> Nor, I hope, is my argument here intended to resemble Fukuyama's "last man" who, with nothing meaningful left to think or do, consigns himself to a life of boredom, hedonism, and directionless toil. <d-footnote>Fukuyama (1992). xxii-xxiii.</d-footnote> Indeed, there are many problems yet to solve, and much still to give our lives some meaning. My claim, put simply, is that modernity's increased scale of consumption has made "object" the most available locus through which to experience the world. I think there are useful links in psychology. In his writings on typology, C.G. Jung stated that "the extroverted thinking type will, by definition, be a man whose constant endeavor.... is to make all his activities dependent on intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always oriented by objective data, whether these be external facts or generally accepted ideas." <d-footnote>Jung (1921). ¶ 585.</d-footnote> Modernity rewards, then, the extroverted thinkers with plenty of objects, real and figurative, through which to engage with the world, and at the same time deprives their counterparts - the introverted feeling types - of proportionately meaningful symbols through which to engage with themselves. The introverted feeling type is useful to bring into the conversation because it characterizes someone for whom the subjective images of the self suffice in providing meaning, and to whom the structs of every day social life might seem, at best, superfluous; at worst, grating.<d-footnote>Ibid. ¶ 638, 642. On this, Jung writes that "introverted feeling is conditioned subjectively and is only secondarily concerned with the object," while primarily concerning itself with "deeply felt, unconscious images."</d-footnote>

#### II. Masks

Our preoccupation with objects means that we will tend to wear masks when we participate in social institutions, insofar as engaging with the world outside of ourselves - full of things and people with their own interests, ideologies, and agency - requires us to sacrifice certain aspects of our true self in order to facilitate a functioning society. I am not trying to assert that masks are bad per se, but instead point out some of their drawbacks. To one person, masks might be a source of stress when the mask deprives them of opportunities for genuine self-expression; to another person, masks might be a comfortable way to avoid introspection or personal growth, which, though sometimes difficult, is nonetheless good for long term satisfaction in life. Nor am I trying to assert that masks are some kind of new phenomenon, but rather that modernity has given them new forms and thrusts them upon us at every turn: literal mask wearing, like Comic-Con attendees dressing as their favorite heroes and villains; physical masks, like a face-lift or plastic surgery; abstract masks, like a professionally-curated social media presence - all of these have given us new pathways to hide ourselves away from each other, and from ourselves. But I think that humans understand the disadvantages of an "over masked" society and have developed structs for recognizing and moving away from a masked persona when doing so promotes the social good. I think a good example of such a struct is the image of the third eye, itself a sort of mask that is commonly used in art to represent introspection and self-awareness, helping us understand and realize certain truths about ourselves. <d-footnote>Napier (1987). 139, 149.</d-footnote> It is commonly worn in subcontinental culture as a tilaka, which is a sort of mask drawn on a person's forehead.

The third eye gazes inward, yes. But it is also an instrument of destruction. In the Hindu tradition, Shiva's third eye opens to eradicate evil from the universe. Likewise, the third eye as a human symbol proposes to uproot those things about ourselves that are not desirable and force us instead to reckon with the subjective self. In that way, it is sort of an "anti-mask", as we train it inward just as we might display it outward; we employ it as a way of realization, rather than as a form of obfuscation. My favorite illustration of the third eye serving this function is Frank Herbert's Dune, where characters invoke the image to overcome their fear.<d-footnote>Herbert (1965).</d-footnote>

#### III. Flow

Introspection can be a troubling business because it forces us to confront certain aspects of ourselves about which we are least comfortable and have hidden away from the gaze of others. But to build a life that is fulfilling, we must sometimes endure discomfort. Some people reject, rebel, or run away from themselves (through, for example, drug use or vapid consumerism) or from society (like a hermit who goes to live in the woods). But there may be a third option in the cultivation of flow, by which I mean the feeling of ecstasy that we experience through total, active involvement of the self with the world around it. <d-footnote>Csikszentmihalyi (1997). 71.</d-footnote> Flow is interesting to me because it is something that allows us to immerse ourselves in society's activities (or activities outside of society, like backpacking or rock climbing) without alienating us from the self. The chief accomplishment of someone who reaches flow quite often is the "Autotelic Personality," which refers to one who enjoys their activities for their own sake, rather than for the material benefits they might bestow.

Take, for example, my decision to start this blog. In many ways, doing so is antithetical to my [midwest-nice](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Midwest%20Nice) outlook toward life, which entails, amongst other things, an appreciation of humility in myself and others. Something about writing about myself or, even worse, presuming others might want to read about me strikes me as particularly self-indulgent and inconsistent with my worldview. And yet, here I am, and here you are. At the risk sounding somewhat attenuated, there's an essay called "This is Water" by David Foster Wallace - well rehearsed across American college campuses at this point, but nonetheless useful to us here - where he tells the story of a religious man and an atheist arguing over the existence of God. The atheist shares a story about how he had been caught in a snowstorm a few weeks before and prayed to God to save him. The religious man is relieved because, seeing as the atheist survived, it wa clear to him that it was God who had saved him. But the atheist writes him off, instead dedicating his salvation to a few passers-by who pulled him from the snow.<d-footnote>Wallace (2009).</d-footnote> Wallace highlights how both men mapped their subjective beliefs onto the atheist's life-or-death experience, without necessarily directing their attention toward, or cultivating any manner of consciousness about, the other's perspective.

#### IV. Interfaces

I am somebody who primarily views the world through the lens of [interfaces](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api). Facilitating interconnectivity between systems is a deeply pleasing process that is, to me, its own reward. I usually apply this idea to manmade systems, instruments, and ideas; but I am very grateful to have discovered that this concept is useful in other areas of life. What I appreciated about the moment I spent in the Beaver River was the sparks of interconnectivity I felt between my subjective self and the objective world around it as my attention fastened to it. Throughout my life, I have often drunk water when I was thirsty and covered myself in a blanket when I was cold but, in the theme of Wallace's essay, this was a rare moment where I could recognize the water I was swimming in. After sitting in the Beaver River for awhile, I stood up and felt a warm breeze brush against my limbs, recalling a verse I had memorized in my youth. <d-footnote>Chaucer (c. 1400). 1.1.</d-footnote>

So, I've decided to call this blog [`zephyrus`](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/zephyrus-e12216400), something I am doing 'for its own sake' where I can lay down the masks compelled unto me by society and reflect upon & celebrate themes of aesthetic beauty and individual uniqueness through the intellectual lenses available to me, like literature, history, computer science, law, etc. I hope that, like a summer breeze, it is a source of comfort to you as it is to me.
