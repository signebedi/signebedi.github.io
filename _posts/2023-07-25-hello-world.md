A few weeks ago, I was backpacking on the Superior Hiking Trail and had the chance to relax with my group at Beaver River, a trail and campground north of Two Harbors, MN. The site had access to the water, which was cool, gently-flowing, and soothing. I spent some time sitting half-submerged and enjoyed the tranquil sounds of birdsong, the rustling of leaves in the wind, and the water lapping against nearby stones as my group set up camp. I closed my eyes and pictured a knot unwinding against the sensation of water rising and falling against my back & my life stressors left my body.

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities my life has provided to participate in the activities, rituals, and institutions of western society, but, as my participation in these has increased, so too have the transaction costs, which waste our time, frustrate us, and deprive us of perspective. One one hand, these can be written off as the price we pay to enjoy society's abstractions; on the other, they make life less fulfilling and breed resentment against the very abstraction that has made the material quality of life improve so much in the last century.
