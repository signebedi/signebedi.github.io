A few weeks ago, I was backpacking on the Superior Hiking Trail and had the chance to relax with my group at Beaver River, a trail and campground north of Two Harbors, MN. The site had access to the water, which was cool, gently-flowing, and soothing. I spent some time sitting half-submerged and enjoyed the tranquil sounds of birdsong, the rustling of leaves in the wind, and the water lapping against nearby stones as my group set up camp. I closed my eyes and pictured a knot unwinding against the sensation of water rising and falling against my back & my life stressors left my body.

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities my life has provided to participate in the activities, rituals, and institutions of western society, but, as my participation in these has increased, so too have the transaction costs, which waste our time, frustrate us, and deprive us of perspective. One one hand, these can be written off as the price we pay to enjoy society's abstractions; on the other, they make life less fulfilling and breed resentment against the very abstraction that has made the material quality of life improve so much in the last century.

What strikes me most about modernity is our remarkable preoccupation with objects. That's not to say that past societies were unconcerned with material culture, but that the increased scale of consumption has made the object the most available locus of experience. In his writings on personality typology, C.J. Jung stated that "the extroverted thinking type will, by definition, be a man whose constant endeavor - in so far, of course, as he is a pure type - is to make all his activities dependent on intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always oriented by objective data, whether these be external facts or generally accepted ideas." <d-cite key="jung1921psychological"></d-cite> Likewise, the modern west rewards the extroverted thinkers with plenty of objects through which to analyze the world, and at the same time deprives their counterparts - the introverted feeling types - of proportionately meaningful symbols.

Preoccupation with the object means that we are all wearing masks when we participate in social instututions, because we are engaging with things outside of ourselves and not seriously engaging with the subjective aspects of ourselves. Masks are far from a new phenomenon, but modernity has given them new forms: literal mask wearing, like Comic-Con attendees dressing as their favorite heroes and villains; physical masks, like a face-lift or plastic surgery; abstract masks, like a professionally-curated social media presence - all of these have given us new pathways to hide ourselves away from each other, and from ourselves.

One of the most intriguing masks is that of the third eye, an image that symbolizes a looking-inward, which helps us understand and realize certain truths about ourselves.<d-cite key="napier1987masks"></d-cite> But, just as the third eye gazes inward, it is also an instrument of destruction as we uproot those things about ourselves that are not desirable and force a reckoning with subjective experience. In that way, it is sort of an "anti-mask", as we train it inward as a way of realization rather than display it outward as a form of obfuscation.

My favorite illustration of this anti-mask is Frank Herbert's Litany Against, “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”<d-cite key="herbert1965dune"></d-cite> Introspection can be a troubling business because it forces us to confront certain aspects of ourselves about which we are least comfortable and have hidden away from the gaze of others. But to build a life that is fulfilling, we must sometimes endure discomfort. Some people reject, rebel, or run away from themselves (through vapid consumerism and a brain left hazy by pop culture) or from society (like a hermit who goes to live in the woods); but there may be a third option in the cultivation of flow, by which I mean the feeling ecstasy that we experience through total, active involvement of the self with the world around it.<d-cite key="csikszentmihalyi1997finding"></d-cite> Flow is interesting to me because it is something that allows us to immerse ourselves in social acitivities without alienating us from our selves.Related to this is the idea of the "Autotelic personality," a type of person who enjoys activities for their own sake, rather than for the benefits they might bestow.

After sitting awhile in Beaver River, I rose from the water and the summer breeze ran sweetly across my limbs, filling me with a sense of wellbeing. It recalled a verse I had memorized in my youth.<d-cite key="chaucer2023"></d-cite>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="line">
            <div class="original">Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth</div>
            <div class="translation">When the West Wind also with its sweet breath</div>
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            <div class="original">Inspired hath in every holt and heeth</div>
            <div class="translation">In every wood and field has breathed life into</div>
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            <div class="original">The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne</div>
            <div class="translation">The tender new leaves, and the young sun</div>
        </div>
        <div class="line">
            <div class="original">Hath in the Ram his half cours yronne,</div>
            <div class="translation">Has run half its course in Aries</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

So, in honor of this experience, I will call this blog `zephyrus`, something I am doing 'for its own sake'. I pray it be like a summer breeze to those who read it.

Marie von Franz writes of the extraverted thinking type "". (ref: __)

- Autotelic (ref: MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI, Finding Flow)
- Social "Masks" (ref: )

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
― Frank Herbert, Dune

I'd like to write my next paragraph with a focus on our preoccupation with objects which, while not necessarily different from past societies, is made worse by the massive increase in the capacity for consumption. This is related fundamentally to Jung's extroverted thinking type, who tries always to focus his activities on preconceived notions about the world:

> The extroverted thinking type will, by definition, be a man whose constant endeavor - in so far, of course, as he is a pure type - is to make all his activities dependent on intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always oriented by objective data, whether these be external facts or generally accepted ideas. <d-cite key="jung1921psychological"></d-cite>

Thus, we are engaged always in the construction of social masks - facilitated in real ways, as in the wearing of costumes or in getting botox; as well as in more indirect ways, like the selective distribution of information about the self over social media. Neither either is the use of mask any different from past times, see <d-cite key="napier1987masks"></d-cite>. But is has been made more extreme than in past times.

But one of the most interesting "Masks" is the third eye - a conceptual eye that we train inward to look upon the self and understand / comprehend / realize a certain truth. Think eg. of Herbert's litany against fear:

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
― Frank Herbert, Dune

But all of this is horrendously troubling business. What is the escape? Need we escape? It is one thing, to recede to the mountains and remain a hermit, contemplating inner truths for the rest of one's life. 

Or, perhaps more preferable, we should lean into the world that we have created and cultivate more reasonable forms of meaning. For that reason, we should be mindful to cultivate flow, as in <d-cite key="csikszentmihalyi1997finding"></d-cite>. That is to say, to cultivate a focus and fascination with the object. Likewise, it is worth considering cultivating an Autotelic personality; that is, one where we focus on the activity instead of its purpose, thus freeing ourselves from the constraints of "extroverted thinker" namely the need to act in accordance with intellectual conclusions, but rather enjoy those things which we do for their own sake.
