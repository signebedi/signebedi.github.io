I have the distinct pleasure of teaching a course this semester on how Liberalism and Conservatism shaped American history. Part of the difficulty of teaching this subject is in helping students understand how and why the underlying concepts change over time. This presents an interesting "teaching methods" challenged that I've contemplated throughout the semester and struggled to find a good solution for. 

I view this fundamentally as a definitional problem: it's hard to pin down a comprehensive meaning for Liberalism or Conservatism, partly because of the long, complex history of the two traditions, partly because of the mixing of theories that practical politics tends to effectuate. Early in the class, we tackled this by building mind maps of both ideas, establishing links and anti-links to gain a better understanding of each theory's tenets and how they related. Recurring themes for Liberalism tended to include concepts like change, progress, free markets, liberty, and equality, while Conservatism usually included tradition, religion, hierarchy, and stability. But this still didn't account for changes to the ideas over time - that is, why a tenent like "tradition" might look different if you examine how the principle is carried out in the 18th Century as opposed to the 21st Century.

In law school, I took Trusts and Estates with a remarkable and engaging professor named Howard Erlanger, and part of his teaching method involved approaching complex ideas through a set of "Erlanger's Paradoxes." I had a chance to sit down with him and pick his brain about my somewhat comparable pedagogical predicament, leading to what I've taken to calling, in conscious emulation of my intellectual upstream, "Sig's Abstractions."

I'm writing this post *in media res* (with mixed feelings about my students reading it) because doing so has been helpful in developing the abstractions further, as well as a language to discuss them with my students. It's important to note, however - and I hope my students understand this - that this discussions is primarily rooted in the American context and the interpretations of Liberalism and Conservatism presented here may grate with non-American perspectives on the same.

#### I. The horse race

The first problem I've experienced in teaching Liberalism and Conservatism is, put simply, why neither of these ideas look exactly the same as they did in the past. As an example: Adam Smith's Liberalism placed, I think, a far greater emphasis on free markets than today's Liberalism, which has adopted intervention as a core tenet. To square this circle, we would probably need to reach two conclusions: first, that Liberalism outpaces conservatism; second, that Conservatism is nonetheless also a "moving" idea that changes over time, though perhaps not at the same pace as Liberalism. I find that this is best illustrated by the analogy of a horse race: if Liberalism and Conservatism were two horses that, for the purpose of the discussion, are situated at the same starting gate, then which horse will outpace the other at any arbitrary time?

If you put your money on Liberalism, then you've correctly made sense of the analogy. But, a more challenging question: does the fact that Liberalism outpaces Conservatism mean that the Conservatism horse never left the starting post? Of course not. Conservatism tried to keep up with the faster horse but never outpaces it because, to it, the race is not necessarily to the fastest. Perhaps, to take this analogy a bit firther, Conservatism wishes that the race were oriented in the opposite direction, but at the same time doesn't want to be left behind by the faster horse running the other way. Thus, we see Conservatism today adopt all manner of ideas that, in the 19th Century, might have seemed alien to those who used that label to describe themselves.

#### II. Caduceus

The second teaching problem I've experienced is why the two ideas seem sometimes to leverage similar language and ideas, or might be used to justify the same policies, despite differing significantly in their intellectual tradition and worldview. A good way to think about this might be that Liberalism and Conservatism are not ideas that exist in a vacuum - their scholars read each other's work and respond to the same events, and intertexts are inevitable when given enough time. A useful way to visualize how concepts might converge is the image of the caduceus, a symbol that depicts two snakes wrapped around a staff and aptly conveys a sense of mediation and diplomacy. Beyond my personal predilection for the classics, I've found that students are also interested in the strange symbols from antiquity and think that the novelty of the image helps grab and keep their attention.

So, in visualizing this abstraction in a manner similar to the first, we might plot Liberalism and Conservatism as a wave function and its inverse, with the two waves periodically intersecting with one another.

#### III. Ouroboros

The two previous abstractions presume that knowledge, culture, and institutions are constantly moving forward. However, this linear progression doesn't always hold true in the real world. Ideas don't just move forward; they also circle back, revisiting and reinterpreting past concepts. This leads us to a third teaching problem: why the ideas often seem to hearken back or revert to past approaches. Admittedly, this phenomenon is something that will become more apparent in discussions of more recent events as we are able to observe how history sometimes "repeats itself." For example, debates around the First National Bank were largely focused on constitutional interpretation, but later debates were able to leverage experience and history as evidence for or against the bank's rechartering.

The practice of "hearkening back" might be a less surprising phenomenon for Conservatism, which places far greater an emphasis on history and tradition - but even Liberalism has a tendency toward archaics. Take, for instance, the resurgence of classical liberal ideas among libertarians. While classical liberalism emphasizes individual liberty and limited government, it's been reinterpreted and adapted by modern libertarians to address contemporary issues. Whether or not libertarians constitute a Liberal or Conservative group will necessarily invite debate, but what's clear is that their core tenets draw heavily from early Liberal thought.

I think this idea is nicely modeled by the tail eater (Attic: οὐροβόρος), another ancient symbol of life, death, and rebirth - or, in a more abstract sense, the cyclicality that permeates all areas of life, to help illustrate how Liberalism and Conservatism don't just move forward, but can sometimes hearken to old arrangements.

Represented in the same manner as the earlier two abstractions, it might look like two circles converging back upon themselves.
