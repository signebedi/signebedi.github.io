The site had access to the water, which was cool to the touch and flowed gently downstream. I spent some time sitting half-submerged and enjoyed the tranquil sounds of birdsong, the rustling of leaves in the wind, and the water lapping against nearby stones as my group set up their tents. I closed my eyes and pictured a knot unwinding as the water rose and fell against my back. My body and mind resonated with my surroundings as I felt my life’s stressors leaving my body.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-07-25-beaver-creek.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Beaver River (source: author) </div> <p>I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities my life has provided to participate in the activities, rituals, and institutions of modern, western society, but, as the scope of my participation in these has increased, so too have the transaction costs, which waste our time, frustrate us, and deprive us of perspective. We all experience these transaction costs, or at least are aware of their existence - commuting time, monthly fees, paperwork, and a thousand login credentials. On one hand, these can be written off as the price we pay to enjoy society’s abstractions; on the other, they make life less fulfilling and breed resentment against the very things that have improved our material quality of life so much in the last century.</p> <p>What strikes me most about modernity is our remarkable preoccupation with objects. That’s not to say that past societies were unconcerned with material culture, but that the increased scale of consumption has made the object the most available locus through which to experience the world. In his writings on typology, C.J. Jung stated that “the extroverted thinking type will, by definition, be a man whose constant endeavor - in so far, of course, as he is a pure type - is to make all his activities dependent on intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always oriented by objective data, whether these be external facts or generally accepted ideas.” <d-cite key="jung1921psychological"></d-cite> Likewise, the modern west rewards the extroverted thinkers with plenty of objects through which to engage with the world, and at the same time deprives their counterparts - the introverted feeling types - of proportionately meaningful symbols through which to engage with themselves. On this, Jung writes that “introverted feeling is conditioned subjectively and is only secondarily concerned with the object,” while primarily concerning itself with “deeply felt, unconscious images.” <d-cite key="jung1921psychological"></d-cite></p> <p>Preoccupation with the object means that we are all wearing masks when we participate in social instututions, because we are engaging with things outside of ourselves and not seriously engaging with the subjective aspects of ourselves. Masks are far from a new phenomenon, but modernity has given them new forms: literal mask wearing, like Comic-Con attendees dressing as their favorite heroes and villains; physical masks, like a face-lift or plastic surgery; abstract masks, like a professionally-curated social media presence - all of these have given us new pathways to hide ourselves away from each other, and from ourselves. But not all masks are about hiding. For example, the image of the third eye is commonly used in art to represent introspection and self-awareness, helping us understand and realize certain truths about ourselves. <d-cite key="napier1987masks"></d-cite> It is commonly worn in subcontinental culture as a tilaka (also commonly called a tika), which is a form of design drawn on a person’s forehead.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-07-25-tika.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Nepali sadhu with a tilaka on his forehead (source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kathmandu,_Nepal,_Sadhu.jpg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vyacheslav Argenberg / http://www.vascoplanet.com/</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CC BY 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons) </div> <p>But, just as the third eye gazes inward, it is also an instrument of destruction as we uproot those things about ourselves that are not desirable, forcing us to reckon with our subjective experience. In that way, it is sort of an “anti-mask”, as we train it inward just as we might display it outward; we employ it as a way of realization, rather than as a form of obfuscation. My favorite illustration of the third eye serving this function is Frank Herbert’s Dune, where characters invoke the image to overcome their fear.<d-cite key="herbert1965dune"></d-cite></p> <div class="poem"> <div class="stanza"> <div class="line"> <div class="original">I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">I will face my fear.</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Only I will remain.</div> </div> </div> </div> <p>Introspection can be a troubling business because it forces us to confront certain aspects of ourselves about which we are least comfortable and have hidden away from the gaze of others. But to build a life that is fulfilling, we must sometimes endure discomfort. Some people reject, rebel, or run away from themselves (through vapid consumerism and a brain left hazy by pop culture) or from society (like a hermit who goes to live in the woods); but there may be a third option in the cultivation of flow, by which I mean the feeling ecstasy that we experience through total, active involvement of the self with the world around it. <d-cite key="csikszentmihalyi1997finding"></d-cite> Flow is interesting to me because it is something that allows us to immerse ourselves in social acitivities without alienating us from our selves. Related to this is the idea of the “Autotelic personality,” a type of person who enjoys activities for their own sake, rather than for the benefits they might bestow.</p> <p>After sitting awhile in Beaver River, I rose from the water and the summer breeze ran sweetly across my limbs, filling me with a sense of wellbeing. It recalled a verse I had memorized in my youth. <d-cite key="chaucer2023"></d-cite></p> <div class="poem"> <div class="stanza"> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth</div> <div class="translation">When the West Wind also with its sweet breath</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Inspired hath in every holt and heeth</div> <div class="translation">In every wood and field has breathed life into</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne</div> <div class="translation">The tender new leaves, and the young sun</div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="original">Hath in the Ram his half cours yronne,</div> <div class="translation">Has run half its course in Aries</div> </div> </div> </div> <p>So, in honor of this experience, I’ve decided to call this blog <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zephyrus</code>, something I am doing ‘for its own sake’.
